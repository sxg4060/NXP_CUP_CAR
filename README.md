# NXP CUP CAR CHALLENGE

The NXP Cup Car challenge is a competition that is held annually that consists of embedded systems programming
of DC motors and a line-scan camera. The DC motor operates the two rear tires; differential drive was established as
well. Furthermore, the line-scan camera detects a light pattern (dark = '1' and light '0') of length 128 bits. Dark 
patterns indicated the edges of tracks whereas light patterns represent the surface of the track. To successfully 
drive through the course, derivatives of light bit patterns were taken to ensure proper turning and braking points
throughtout the course.
